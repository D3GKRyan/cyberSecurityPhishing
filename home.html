  <h1><b>What is PHISHING?</b></h1>
  <p> - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fraudulent practice of sending emails
     purporting to be from reputable companies in order
     to induce individuals to reveal personal information,
     such as passwords and credit card numbers or harm systems.</p>

  <h1>So what?</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center">Phishers can do much more than just steal your accounts.<br>Here is a list
  of types of phishing attacks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i class ="bold">Deceptive</i> - Requests verification on your account. (Sent randomly)</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Keyloggers and Screen loggers</i> - Software that tracks your keystrokes or screen sessions.
      Used for stealing credentials or habits.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Session Hijacking</i> - Hijack user sessions when they sign in to an account.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Web Trojans</i> - Invisible pop ups that collects user credentials for accounts.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Host File Posioning</i> - Takes user to fake replica website. Used for stealing log in information.
      This one is often hard to identify. &nbsp;<b> ALWAYS</b> pay attention to your browser links!!!</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">System Reconfiguration Attacks</i> - Modify settings on your PC for malicious or unwanted use.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Data Theft</i> - Transporting private information to phisher with unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Content-Injection</i> - Hijack a legitimate site with false information that is meant
      to mislead the audience.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Man-in-the-Middle</i> - Stands between the use rand real transaction, recording
      everything that is typed in and clicked on.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Ransomware</i> - Software designed to block system access until cryptocurrency is paid.
    You often don't hear about organizations get attacked like this because they often cough
  up the ransome before the news gets leaked.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Logic Bomb</i> - Hidden piece of code that can be programmed to begin deleting files.</li>
    <li><i class ="bold">Rootkit</i> - Makes files modifiable when they're not supposed to be (ex: operating system files).
    This is the equivalent to jailbreaking.</li>

  </ul>
